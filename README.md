My Very Own VIM Config with a number of third-party plugins set up. :)

Make sure to set your main .vimrc to `runtime vimrc`

Plug is being used
https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug

Run :PlugInstall to install dependencies
If it doesn't work, make :PlugClean first

Silver Searcher being used for ag

Run brew install the_silver_searcher
or apt-get the_silver_searcher

Run brew install ranger for ranger integration
or download ranger from their git repository and `make` manually.

If the bundle plugins don't work from Pathogen, make sure the submodules are cloned
